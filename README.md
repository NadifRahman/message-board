A project I made to practice server-side programming with NodeJS and ExpressJS. An MVC architecture was used. User authentication was carried out 
using the PassportJS library (particularly the local strategy using session-storage). The EJS rendering engine was used to render views dynamically. 
Bootstrap 5 was used as a CSS framework for the styling. MongoDB and Mongoose (ODM for MongoDB in NodeJS) was used to store persistent information such as messages or user info.
